Hey there! Name's douEXYZT, although I also go by EXYZT, Ex, Hex, and "Father Void"... that last one is a bit of an inside joke alongside my friends.

I'm 13 years old, I'm a gamer, I play a lot, primarily on PC, and I'm actually looking to make Games too.

I made this account primarily so I could collaborate with my friends, who are also interested in becoming developers, we like to call ourselves "Team Soul".

I am (currently) not accepting any sort of collaborations with others as "Team Soul" is basically my main priority.

If anyone wants to contact me, for SOME reason, I have a discord account you may use, it's the most reliable method, so it's the only one I'll be including.

I think that's all for now, seeya!
